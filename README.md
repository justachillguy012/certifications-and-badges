# Certifications & Badges

Welcome to my curated gallery of achievements — a testament to the skills I've honed and the knowledge I've earned.  
Within this collection lie the verified badges and certificates that chronicle my journey through MongoDB, ethical hacking, programming, and beyond.

Each credential reflects dedication, growth, and a relentless pursuit of mastery.  
This space serves not only as a record of accomplishments but also as an invitation — to recruiters, collaborators, and fellow learners alike — to witness the evolution of my craft.
